The Hall of Famer ended his playing career with 38,387 points, putting him alone atop the league's all-time scoring list. More than three decades later, another Lakers star is nearing Abdul - Jabbar 's incredible mark. LeBron James is on pace to pass Abdul-Jabbar and widen the gap between the two basketball legends before the end of the 2022-23 season."
